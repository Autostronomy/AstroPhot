  We present AstroPhot, a fast, powerful, and user-friendly
  Python based astronomical image photometry solver.
  AstroPhot incorporates automatic differentiation and GPU
  (or parallel CPU) acceleration, powered by the machine
  learning library PyTorch. Everything: AstroPhot can fit
  models for sky, stars, galaxies, PSFs, and more in a
  principled Chi^2 forward optimization, recovering Bayesian
  posterior information and covariance of all parameters.
  Everywhere: AstroPhot can optimize forward models on CPU
  or GPU; across images that are large, multi-band,
  multi-epoch, rotated, dithered, and more. All at once: The
  models are optimized together, thus handling overlapping
  objects and including the covariance between parameters
  (including PSF and galaxy parameters). A number of
  optimization algorithms are available including
  Levenberg-Marquardt, Gradient descent, and No-U-Turn MCMC
  sampling. With an object-oriented user interface,
  AstroPhot makes it easy to quickly extract detailed
  information from complex astronomical data for individual
  images or large survey programs.
