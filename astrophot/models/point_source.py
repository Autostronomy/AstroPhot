        This function is designed to compute the model on a given
        image or within a specified window. It takes care of sub-pixel
        sampling, recursive integration for high curvature regions,
        PSF convolution, and proper alignment of the computed model

          window (Optional[Window]): A window within which to evaluate the model.
                                   Should only be used if a subset of the full image
