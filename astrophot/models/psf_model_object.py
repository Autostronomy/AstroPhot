    PSF_Models behave differently than component models. For starters,

    Target_Image object. PSF_Models also don't define a "center"
    variable since their center is always (0,0) just like a
    PSF_Image. A PSF_Model will never be convolved with a PSF_Model
    (that's it's job!), so a lot of the sampling method is simpler.

        This function is designed to compute the model on a given
        image or within a specified window. It takes care of sub-pixel
        sampling, recursive integration for high curvature regions,
        and proper alignment of the computed model with the original
        pixel grid. The final model is then added to the requested
        image.

        **Args:**
        -  `window` (Optional[Window]): A window within which to evaluate the model.
                                   Should only be used if a subset of the full image
