    """The Airy disk is an analytic description of the diffraction pattern
    for a circular aperture.

    The diffraction pattern is described exactly by the configuration
    of the lens system under the assumption that all elements are
    perfect. This expression goes as:

    $$I(\\theta) = I_0\\left[\\frac{2J_1(x)}{x}\\right]^2$$
    $$x = ka\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{2\\pi a r}{\\lambda R}$$

    where $I(\\theta)$ is the intensity as a function of the
    angular position within the diffraction system along its main
    axis, $I_0$ is the central intensity of the airy disk,
    $J_1$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one,
    $k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$ is the wavenumber of the
    light, $a$ is the aperture radius, $r$ is the radial
    position from the center of the pattern, $R$ is the distance
    from the circular aperture to the observation plane.

    In the `Airy_PSF` class we combine the parameters
    $a,R,\\lambda$ into a single ratio to be optimized (or fixed
    by the optical configuration).

    **Parameters:**
    -    `I0`: The central intensity of the airy disk in flux/arcsec^2.
    -    `aRL`: The ratio of the aperture radius to the
        product of the wavelength and the distance from the aperture to the
        observation plane, $\\frac{a}{R \\lambda}$.
