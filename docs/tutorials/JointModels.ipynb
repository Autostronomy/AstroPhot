    "# Joint Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn how to set up a joint modelling fit which encoporates the data from multiple images. These use `Group_Model` objects just like in the `GroupModels.ipynb` tutorial, the main difference being how the `Target_Image` object is constructed and that more care must be taken when assigning targets to models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is, of course, more work to set up a fit across multiple target images. However, the tradeoff can be well worth it. Perhaps there is space-based data with high resolution, but groundbased data has better S/N. Or perhaps each band individually does not have enough signal for a confident fit, but all three together just might. Perhaps colour information is of paramount importance for a science goal, one would hope that both bands could be treated on equal footing but in a consistent way when extracting profile information. There are a number of reasons why one might wish to try and fit a multi image picture of a galaxy simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "When fitting multiple bands one often resorts to forced photometry, somtimes also blurring each image to the same approximate PSF. With AutoPhot this is entirely unecessary as one can fit each image in its native PSF simultaneously. The final fits are more meaningful and can encorporate all of the available structure information."

    "## Joint models with multiple models\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to analyze more than a single astronomical object, you will need to combine many models for each image in a reasonable structure. There are a number of ways to do this that will work, though may not be as scalable. For small images, just about any arrangement is fine when using the LM optimizer. But as images and number of models scales very large, it may be neccessary to sub divide the problem to save memory. To do this you should arrange your models in a hierarchy so that AutoPhot has some information about the structure of your problem. There are two ways to do this. First, you can create a group of models where each sub-model is a group which holds all the objects for one image. Second, you can create a group of models where each sub-model is a group which holds all the representations of a single astronomical object across each image. The second method is preferred. See the diagram below to help clarify what this means.\n",

We can see in the observed image that there are spiral arms, those can easily cause large scale residual patterns. Also for the W1 band image there is a missalignment to some degree, which is giving higher residuals. This can happen for low resolution data and an iterative process may be needed to get all bands to agree. The NUV band looks excellent."

It is possible to fit a time series dataset with a shared galaxy model across multiple images, and a shared position for the supernova, but a variable brightness for the supernova over each image. \n",
