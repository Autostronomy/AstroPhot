    "# Batch models\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will describe how to perform batch modelling. This is a specific application where one needs many instances of the same kind of model, and those models do not take up much space. An example to keep in mind is a survey for which many of the objects are PSF limited galaxies, or faint stars; in this case a small cutout is sufficent and the same model (e.g. sersic galaxy model) may be applied to all of them. The reason one may want to do this is purely for performance improvements, because each operation is now being applied to an array instead of a single value, the code spends more time computing in the efficient numerical libraries instead of the slow python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, a batch model is the same as a regular model, except in a few key places one replaces a single value with an array of values. The PyTorch backend is able to perform operations (addition, multiplication, etc.) on these arrays instead of the single values and effectively work with many models simultaneously. However, the restriction is that all of these batch models are sharing the same configuration. PSF convolution, for example, must be applied to all models or none. Similarly, if you wish to fix the inclination, you must do so for all the batch models."
