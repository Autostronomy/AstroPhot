    "# Multiband Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn how to set up multiband model fits. These are formatted similarly to Group_Model objects, the main difference being that every model has a unique target to fit. That said, one \"model\" for a multiband model object could itself be a full Group_Model object so in truth there are no limitations to what can be fit across multiple bands! \n",
    "\n",
    "It is, of course, more work to set up a fit across multiple wavelength bands. However, the tradeoff can be well worth it in some cases. Perhaps there is space-based data with high resolution, but groundbased data has better S/N. Or perhaps each band individually does not have enough signal for a confident fit, but all three together just might. Perhaps colour information is of paramount importance for a science goal, one would hope that both bands could be treated on equal footing but in a consistent way when extracting profile information. There are a number of reasons why one might wish to try and fit a multiband picture of a galaxy simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "When fitting multiple bands one often resorts to forced photometry, somtimes also blurring each image to the same approximate PSF. With AutoProf this is entirely unecessary as one can fit each image in its native PSF simultaneously. The final fits are more meaningful and can encorporate all of the available structure information."

    "## Group models of multiband models\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to analyze more than a single astronomical object, you will need to mix and match group models with multiband models. This can get a bit confusing, since both group models and multiband models are able to hold multiple sub models. To keep it straight always remember that a group model holds many sub models which all have the same target, while a multiband model holds sub models which each have a distinct target. Thus there are two ways to model many astronomical objects across different bands. First, you can create a distinct group model for each band (all sub models have the same target band), then have a multiband model which holds the group models (each group model has a different target band). Second, you can have a distinct multiband model for each astronomical object represented across each band (each submodel is for a different band), then have a group model which holds all of these multiband models (which all have the same \"target\" which is a Target_Image_List object). The second method is generally prefered as it is easier for the optimizers to work with, and is also easier to keep track of since each multiband model holds all the information for a given astronomical object.\n",

    "Note that the last point in several of the profiles turns up. This is due to the very limited modelling being done here. If we had included the neighboring objects then this would not happen. Earlier we set extend_profile = False for the nonparametric models. This way the profile behavior is not much of a problem. Had we left extend_profile = True then AutoProf would assume an exponential profile based on the last two points of the profile and extend infinitely, which is obviously bad if it is increasing."
