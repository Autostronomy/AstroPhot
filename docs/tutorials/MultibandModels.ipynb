    "# Multiband Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn how to set up multiband model fits. These are formatted similarly to Group_Model objects, the main difference being that every model has a unique target to fit. That said, one \"model\" for a multiband model object could itself be a full Group_Model object so in truth there are no limitations to what can be fit across multiple bands! \n",
    "\n",
    "It is, of course, more work to set up a fit across multiple wavelength bands. However, the tradeoff can be well worth it in some cases. Perhaps there is space-based data with high resolution, but groundbased data has better S/N. Or perhaps each band individually does not have enough signal for a confident fit, but all three together just might. Perhaps colour information is of paramount importance for a science goal, one would hope that both bands could be treated on equal footing but in a consistent way when extracting profile information. There are a number of reasons why one might wish to try and fit a multiband picture of a galaxy simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "When fitting multiple bands one often resorts to forced photometry, somtimes also blurring each image to the same approximate PSF. With AutoProf this is entirely unecessary as one can fit each image in its native PSF simultaneously. The final fits are more meaningful and can encorporate all of the available structure information."
