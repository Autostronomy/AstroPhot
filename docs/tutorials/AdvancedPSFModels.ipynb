    "Fitting a PSF to a galaxy is perhaps not the most stable way to get a good model. However, there is a very common situation where this kind of fitting is quite helpful. Consider the scenario that there is a star, but it is not very bright and it is right next to a galaxy. Now we need to model the galaxy and the star simultaneously, but the galaxy should be convolved with the PSF for the fit to be stable (otherwise you'll have to do several iterations to converge). If there were many stars you could perhaps just stack a bunch of them and hope the average is close enough, but in this case we don't have many to work with so we need to squeeze out as much statistical power as possible.

This shows us that extended objects have plenty of constraining power when it comes to PSF fitting, all this information has previously been left on the table! It makes sense that the galaxy dominates the PSF fit here, while the star is very simple to fit, it has much less light than the galaxy in this scenario so the S/N for the galaxy dominates. The reason this works really well is of course that the true data is in fact a sersic model, so we are working in a very idealized scenario. Real world galaxies are not necessarily well described by a sersic, so it is worthwhile to be cautious when doing this kind of fitting. Always make sure the results make sense before storming ahead with galaxy based PSF models, that said the payoff can be well worth it."
