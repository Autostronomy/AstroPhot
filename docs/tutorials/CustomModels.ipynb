    "## Custom model objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will go over some of the core functionality of AutoProf models so that you can make your own custom models with arbitrary behavior. This is an advanced tutorial and likely not needed for most users. However, the flexibility of AutoProf can be a real lifesaver for some niche applications! If you get stuck trying to make your own models, please contact Connor Stone (see GitHub), he can help you get the model working and maybe even help add it to the core AutoProf model list!\n",
    "\n",
    "### AutoProf model hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoProf models are very much object oriented and inheritence driven. Every AutoProf model inherits from `AutoProf_Model` and so if you wish to make something truly original then this is where you would need to start. However, it is almost certain that is the wrong way to go. Further down the hierarchy is the `Component_Model` object, this is what you will likely use to construct a custom model as it represents a single \"unit\" in the astronomical image. Spline, Sersic, Exponential, Gaussian, PSF, Sky, etc. all of these inherit from `Component_Model` so likely that's what you will want. At its core, a `Component_Model` object defines a center location for the model, but it doesn't know anything else yet. At the same level as `Component_Model` is `Group_Model` which represents a collection of model objects (typically but not always `Component_Model` objects). A `Group_Model` is how you construct more complex models by composing several simpler models. It's unlikely you'll need to inherit from `Group_Model` so we won't discuss this any further (contact the developers if you're thinking about that). \n",
    "\n",
    "Inheriting from `Component_Model` are a few general classes which make it easier to build typical cases. There is the `Galaxy_Model` which adds a position angle and axis ratio to the model; also `Star_Model` which simply enforces no psf convolution on the object since that will be handled internally for anything star like; `Sky_Model` should be used for anything low resolution defined over the entire image, in this model psf convolution and integration are turned off since they shouldn't be needed. Based on these low level classes, you can \"jump in\" where it makes sense to define your model. Of course, you can take any AutoProf model as a starting point and modify it to suit a given task, however we will not list all models here. See the documentation for a more complete list."
