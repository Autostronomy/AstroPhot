AutoProf circumvents this by remapping any constrained parameter to a space where it can take any real value, at least for the sake of fitting. For most parameters these constraints are applied by default; for example the axis ratio q is required to be in the range (0,1). Other parameters, such as the position angle (PA) are cyclic, they can be in the range (0,pi) but also can wrap around. It is possible to manually set these constraints while constructing a model.\n",
