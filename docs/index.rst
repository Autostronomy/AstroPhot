Getting Started
===============

AutoProf is a pipeline for basic and advanced non-parametric galaxy image analysis.
Its design allows for fast startup and provides flexibility to explore new ideas and support advanced users.
It was written by `Connor Stone <https://connorjstone.com/>`_ with contributions from
`Nikhil Arora <https://www.astronikhil.com/>`_,
`St√©phane Courteau <https://www.physics.queensu.ca/facultysites/courteau/>`_,
and `Jean-Charles Cuillandre <https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/~jcc/>`_.

This documentation is a work in progress, further updates will come.

.. note::

    Like much astronomy software, AutoProf is an evolving package.
    I try to keep the API stable and consistent, however I will make
    changes to the interface if it considerably improves things
    going forward. Please contact connor.stone@queensu.ca if you experience
    issues. If you would like to be notified of major changes send an email
    with the subject line "AUTOPROF MAILING LIST".
