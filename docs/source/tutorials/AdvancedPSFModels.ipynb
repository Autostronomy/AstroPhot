If you already have a good guess at some starting parameters then you can just enter them yourself, however if you don't then AstroPhot provides another option; if you have an empirical PSF estimate (a stack of a few stars from the field), then you can have a PSF model initialize itself on the empirical PSF just like how other AstroPhot models can initialize themselves on target images. Let's see how that works!"
