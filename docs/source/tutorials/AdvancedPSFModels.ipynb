    "Before we can optimize a PSF model, we need to make the model and get some starting parameters. If you already have a good guess at some starting parameters then you can just enter them yourself, however if you don't then AstroPhot provides another option; if you have an empirical PSF estimate (a stack of a few stars from the field), then you can have a PSF model initialize itself on the empirical PSF just like how other AstroPhot models can initialize themselves on target images. Let's see how that works!"

To be fair, this example is essentially perfect for this kind of fitting and we knew the true model types (sersic and moffat) from the start.

Consider the scenario that there is a star, but it is not very bright and it is right next to a galaxy. Now we need to model the galaxy and the star simultaneously, but the galaxy should be convolved with the PSF for the fit to be stable (otherwise you'll have to do several iterations to converge). If there were many stars you could perhaps just stack a bunch of them and hope the average is close enough, but in this case we don't have many to work with so we need to squeeze out as much statistical power as possible.

This shows us that extended objects have plenty of constraining power when it comes to PSF fitting, all this information has previously been left on the table! It makes sense that the galaxy dominates the PSF fit here, while the star is very simple to fit, it has much less light than the galaxy in this scenario so the S/N for the galaxy dominates. The reason this works really well is of course that the true data is in fact a sersic model, so we are working in a very idealized scenario. Real world galaxies are not necessarily well described by a sersic, so it is worthwhile to be cautious when doing this kind of fitting. Always make sure the results make sense before storming ahead with galaxy based PSF models, that said the payoff can be well worth it."

    "## PSF fitting for saturated stars\n",
    "\n",
    "A saturated star is a bright star, and it's just begging to be used for modelling a PSF. There's just one catch, the highest signal to noise region is completely messed up and can't be used! Traditionally these stars are either ignored, or a two stage fit is performed to get an \"inner psf\" and an \"outer psf\" which are then merged. Why not fit the inner and outer PSFs all at once! This can be done with AstroPhot using parameter constraints and masking."
