AstroPhot circumvents this by remapping any constrained parameter to a space where it can take any real value, at least for the sake of fitting. For most parameters these constraints are applied by default; for example the axis ratio q is required to be in the range (0,1). Other parameters, such as the position angle (PA) are cyclic, they can be in the range (0,pi) but also can wrap around. It is possible to manually set these constraints while constructing a model.\n",

    "If you are using a GPU you can get significant performance increases in both memory and speed by switching from double precision (the AstroPhot default) to single precision floating point numbers. The trade off is reduced precision, this can cause some unexpected behaviors. For example an optimizer may keep iterating forever if it is trying to optimize down to a precision below what the float32 will track. Typically, numbers with float32 are good down to 6 places and AstroPhot by default only attempts to minimize the Chi^2 to 3 places. However, to ensure the fit is secure to 3 places it often checks what is happenening down at 4 or 5 places. Hence, issues can arise. For the most part you can go ahead with float32 and if you run into a weird bug, try on float64 before looking further."

    "The AstroPhot optimizers, and occasionally the other AstroPhot objects, will provide status updates about themselves which can be very useful for debugging problems or just keeping tabs on progress. There are a number of use cases for AstroPhot, each having different desired output behaviors. To accommodate all users, AstroPhot implements a general logging system. The object `ap.AP_config.ap_logger` is a logging object which by default writes to AstroPhot.log in the local directory. As the user, you can set that logger to be any logging object you like for arbitrary complexity. Most users will, however, simply want to control the filename, or have it output to screen instead of a file. Below you can see examples of how to do that."
