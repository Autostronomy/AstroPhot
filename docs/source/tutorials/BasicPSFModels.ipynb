    "A `PSFImage` is an AstroPhot object which stores the data for a PSF. It records the pixel values for the PSF as well as meta-data like the pixelscale at which it was taken. The point source function (PSF) is a description of how light is distributed into pixels when the light source is a delta function. In Astronomy we are blessed/cursed with many delta function like sources in our images and so PSF modelling is a major component of astronomical image analysis. Here are some points to keep in mind about a PSF.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the most common astronomical sources is a point source. This is a source of light which is so small that it is, for all relevant purposes, infinitely small (a delta function). Though the point source may be extremely small, it's footprint in an image is often quite extended, this is because the optics of a telescope, the intervening atmosphere, and a few other factors, work to broaden the light distribution that would otherwise fall entirely in a single pixel of the detector. The characterization of how the light is \"blurred\" is called a point spread function (PSF). In AstroPhot, there is one model `\"point model\"` which describes all point sources, this is a delta function which gets convolved by a PSF to produce an effect in an image. Thus for a point model, the `psf_mode` is always `\"full\"` since otherwise the model would only ever fill a single pixel. A point source is characterized by two measurements, the position (center), and the flux. Here we can see an example of how to set up a point source model."

To that end, AstroPhot includes a number of approaches to handle PSF convolution. The main concept is that AstroPhot will convolve its model with a PSF before comparing against an image. The PSF behaviour of a model is determined by the `psf_mode` parameter which can be set before fitting."

    "## Supersampled PSF models\n",

    "It is generally best practice to use a PSF model that has been determined at a higher resolution than the image you are analyzing. In AstroPhot this can be easily handled by ensuring that the `PSFImage` has an appropriate pixelscale that shows how it is upsampled. For example if our target has a pixelscale of 0.5 and the PSFImage has a pixelscale of 0.25 then AstroPhot will automatically infer that it should work at 2x higher resolution. Note that AstroPhot assumes the PSF has been determined at an integer level of upsampling, so in the example if you set the PSFImage pixelscale to 0.3 then strange things would likely happen to your images!"
