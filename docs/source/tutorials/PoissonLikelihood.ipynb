    "# Poisson Noise Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, astronomical images are modelled assuming an independent Gaussian uncertainty on every pixel resulting in a negative log likelihood of the form: $\\sum_i\\frac{(d_i-m_i)^2}{2\\sigma_i^2}$ where $d_i$ is the pixel value, $m_i$ is the model value for that pixel, and $\\sigma_i$ is the uncertainty on that pixel. However, in truth the best model for an astronomical image is the Poisson distribution with negative log likelihood of: $\\sum_i m_i + \\log(d_i!) - d_i\\log(m_i)$ with the same definitions, except specifying that $d_i$ is in counts (number of photons or electrons). For large enough $d_i$ these likelihoods are essentially identical and Gaussian is easier to work with. When signal-to-noise ratios get very low, the differences between Poisson and Gaussian distributions can become apparent and so it is important to treat the data with a Poisson likelihood. These conditions regularly occur for gamma ray, x-ray, and low SNR UV data, but are less common for longer wavelengths. AstroPhot can model Poisson likelihood data, here we will demo an example."

    "Lets create some mock low SNR data. Notice that poisson noise isn't additive like gaussian noise. To sample the image, out true model acts as a photon rate and the `np.random.poisson` samples some number of counts based on that rate. Our goal will be to recover the rate of every pixel and ultimately the sersic parameters that produce the correct rate model. "

    "While the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is traditionally considered as a least squares algorithm, that is actually just its most common application. LM naturally generalizes to a broad class of problems, including the Poisson Likelihood (see [Fowler 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014JLTP..176..414F/abstract)). Here we see the AstroPhot automatic initialization does well on this image and recovers decent starting parameters, LM has an easy time finishing the job to find the maximum likelihood.\n",
