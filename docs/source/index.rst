It was written by `Connor Stone <https://connorjstone.com/>`_ .

If you run into any problems, please submit an issue on the `GitHub page <https://github.com/Autostronomy/AstroPhot>`_ or just email me.


.. note::

    Like much astronomy software, AstroPhot is an evolving package.
    I try to keep the API stable and consistent, however I will make
    changes to the interface if it considerably improves things
    going forward. Please contact connorstone628@gmail.com if you experience
    issues. If you would like to be notified of major changes send an email
    with the subject line "ASTROPHOT MAILING LIST".
