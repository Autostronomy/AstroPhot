Tutorial PDFs
=============

Here you will find PDFs of the jupyter notebook tutorials. It is recommended that you go through the tutorials yourself, but for quick reference a PDF version of each tutorial is available here.

Getting Started
---------------

This tutorial explains the basics of the interface when creating and manipulating model objects. `Click here for the pdf <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Autostronomy/AutoPhot/main/docs/tutorials/GettingStarted.pdf?raw=true>`_

Group Models
------------

This tutorial explains how to combine component models into larger more complete representations of an astronomical image. `Click here for the pdf <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Autostronomy/AutoPhot/main/docs/tutorials/GroupModels.pdf?raw=true>`_

Fitting Methods
---------------

This tutorial explains how to run the various fitting methods in AutoPhot, each one is suited to a different class of problems. `Click here for the pdf <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Autostronomy/AutoPhot/main/docs/tutorials/FittingMethods.pdf?raw=true>`_

Model Zoo
---------
